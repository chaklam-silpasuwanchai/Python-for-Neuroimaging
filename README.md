# Python-for-Neuroimaging

A repository holding tutorials of using python to analyze neuroimages.  The tutorial is split into two big components: resting state and task-based which are two major paradigms in neuroscience research.  We shall explore things like cleaning motion artifacts, performing normalization, doing parcellations, and doing GLM in task-based.

## Resting state

## Task-based
